Technical challenge to recreate a Figma component in React

## Assumptions

- Typescript React App created with Create React App
- Chakra UI Styling Libary used
- Non-essential dev packages should be in dev dependancies

## Next Steps

- Testing
- Could make it so that multiple choice questions work?
- Implementing a form libary such as Formik would take away much of the heavy lift
